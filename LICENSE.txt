Technical Frameworks and Standards

This project is built using open-source frameworks and open standards, including:

• React, Vite, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS — each distributed under its own MIT License.
• Model Viewer (WebGL · WebXR · AR Quick Look) — for browser-based 3D and AR rendering.
• WebGL — GPU-accelerated rendering for real-time 3D graphics.
• WebXR (Android) and AR Quick Look (iOS 12+) — for device-level AR rendering and tracking.
• glTF 2.0 (GLB) and USDZ — for efficient and interoperable 3D model formats.
• AI Prediction — MobileNetV2 (quantized) executed locally via ONNX Runtime Web (WASM + SIMD, multithreaded)
  for privacy-preserving, on-device inference.

All computations, including AI prediction and AR rendering, occur entirely on the user’s device.
No sensor data, images, or motion data are transmitted to external servers.
